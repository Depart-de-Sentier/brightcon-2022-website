        We all want to do cool things at work and in private life. The basis for
        this is a good health. Let’s make sure everybody will return home safely
        after the Brightcon event, and let’s try to reduce the risk for getting
        into health troubles for anybody.

        In case of any cold symptoms during the event, we suggest that you wear
        an FFP2 mask whenever possible. In addition, you might do a self-test
        for Covid. Feel free to approach the conference organisers for mask(s)
        and/or a test. Of course you can also choose to wear a mask without
        symptoms. We will strive for good air quality in the rooms.
