    Visualization of life cycle assessment information could be significantly
    improved. Visualization of input data, calculation results, and
    interpretation algorithms helps us understand what we can say, how strongly
    we can believe it, and where we should prioritize future work.
    <br />
    We invite entries on visualization schemes, graph layouts, and interactive
    programs.
