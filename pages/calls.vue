    <h2>Talks</h2>
    <p>
      Talks at Brightcon must be about open source software or data sources for
      industrial ecology or sustainability assessment. Talks will be 15-20
      minutes, with time afterwards for questions. Please note that talks must
      include some interactive element, such as an online notebook or
      demonstration, so that participants can see your project in action.
      Ideally, it should be possible for a small example to be run by the
      audience members themselves, though we recognize that this is not always
      feasible. The conference organizers can help host notebooks online.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recorded talks can be submitted for speakers who can't attend the physical
      conference.
    </p>
    <p>All participants with accepted talks must register to the conference.</p>

    <h3>Talk proposal format</h3>

    <p>
      A talk proposal must include: a description of the proposed talk,
      specification of the interaction that can take place during the conference
      and whether or not the talk will be done live or pre-recorded. The
      proposal must also indicate if the presenter needs help from the
      organizers to publish notebooks online.
    </p>
    <p>
      In previous editions of Brightcon, the submission of proposals was done
      directly by mail.
    </p>
