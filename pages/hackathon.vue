                A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come
                together to solve problems. Most hackathons Iâ€™ve run also have a
                parallel track for workshops.</q

          The different problems to solve during the Brightcon 2022 Hackathon

          There are multiple issues related to a single topic. An issue is a
          smaller task/problem that needs to be solved to consider the topic as
          solved. Below is a list of topics, and the associated "tags" that you
          can use to filter the issues in the repository.

          <ul>

              the "introduction" webpage into different sections, use the
